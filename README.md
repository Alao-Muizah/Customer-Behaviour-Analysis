# Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer behaviour changes over time using transactional data. The goal was to understand how customer's spending patterns evolve across two different periods and to segment them into meaningful groups using K-means clustering. 


Rather than clustering on raw values, the analysis is based on delta(change) features, allowing me to capture behavioural shifts such as increased or decreased spending activity
